# cyclebreathing

A very poorly writen `neovim` plugin that adds (and hopefully one day removes) Smooth breathing marks to Greek text in a file. 

# Usage

```
:AddBreathing
```

This will convert `αιτεω εγω ειμι` into `αίτεω ἐγω είμι`.

# Installation

using `vim-plug`

```
Plug 'fhardison/cyclebreathing`
```
